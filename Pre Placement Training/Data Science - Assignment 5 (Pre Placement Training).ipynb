    "    The K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) algorithm is a supervised machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a non-parametric algorithm, meaning it doesn't make any assumptions about the underlying data distribution.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The main idea behind the KNN algorithm is to classify new data points based on their similarity to existing data points. In other words, it assigns a class or predicts a value for a new data point based on the classes or values of its K nearest neighbors in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Here's a high-level overview of how the KNN algorithm works:\n",
    "\n",
    "    1. Training: The algorithm starts with a labeled training dataset, which consists of input vectors (features) and their corresponding class labels (for classification) or target values (for regression). The features are represented as numerical values.\n",
    "\n",
    "    2. Distance calculation: For a new, unlabeled data point, the algorithm calculates the distance between that data point and all other data points in the training dataset. The distance is typically calculated using measures such as Euclidean distance or Manhattan distance.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Finding nearest neighbors: The algorithm selects the K data points from the training dataset that are closest to the new data point based on the calculated distances. K is a user-defined parameter that determines the number of neighbors to consider.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Majority voting (classification): For classification tasks, the algorithm assigns the class label to the new data point based on a majority vote among its K nearest neighbors. In other words, the class label that occurs most frequently among the neighbors is assigned to the new data point.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Weighted voting (regression): For regression tasks, the algorithm predicts the value for the new data point by taking the average (or weighted average) of the target values of its K nearest neighbors.\n",
    "\n",
    "    6. Prediction: After determining the class label or value for the new data point, the algorithm outputs the result.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The choice of the value of K is important and can impact the performance of the algorithm. A smaller value of K makes the model more sensitive to noise and outliers, while a larger value of K smoothens the decision boundaries but may overlook local patterns.\n",
    "\n",
    "    KNN is relatively simple and easy to understand, but it can be computationally expensive for large datasets since it requires calculating distances between all pairs of data points. Additionally, it is important to preprocess the data and normalize features before applying the KNN algorithm, as features with larger scales can dominate the distance calculations."

    "    Several distance metrics can be used in clustering, depending on the nature of the data. Common distance metrics include Euclidean distance, Manhattan distance, Minkowski distance, and cosine similarity. Euclidean distance is widely used for continuous numerical features, while categorical features can be handled using metrics like Hamming distance or Jaccard distance. The choice of distance metric depends on the data type, scaling requirements, and the underlying assumptions about the data."

One-hot encoding can be applied to convert categorical features into binary vectors, representing the presence or absence of each category. Alternatively, other encoding techniques like ordinal encoding or target encoding can be used to map categorical values to numerical representations. It is important to choose the encoding technique carefully to ensure meaningful distances are calculated between categorical features."

It occurs when the distribution, relationships, or characteristics of the data used for training the model differ from the data that the model encounters during deployment or production. Data drift can be caused by various factors such as changes in the underlying population, shifts in user behavior, or changes in data collection methods."

If the target variable, which represents whether a customer will default on a loan, is determined based on the future behavior of the customer, including features that reflect future events (e.g., whether they have already defaulted) would introduce data leakage. Similarly, including features that are directly influenced by the target variable (e.g., the number of past defaults) would also lead to target leakage. Proper separation of the training and testing datasets and careful feature selection are crucial to prevent data leakage and ensure accurate credit risk predictions."
