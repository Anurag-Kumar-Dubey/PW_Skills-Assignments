Squared loss penalizes larger errors more than absolute loss because it squares the difference between the predicted and true values. As a result, squared loss gives more emphasis to outliers and can be more sensitive to their influence. On the other hand, absolute loss treats all errors equally, regardless of their magnitude. MAE provides a more robust measure of error that is less affected by extreme values."

    "    Support Vector Machines (SVM) is a popular machine learning algorithm used for both classification and regression tasks. It is a supervised learning algorithm that analyzes data and builds a model based on examples provided in the training dataset.\n",
    "\n",
    "    The goal of SVM is to find a hyperplane that separates different classes or groups of data points in the feature space.

Feature Transformation: If the data is not naturally linearly separable, SVM uses a kernel trick to transform the data into a higher-dimensional feature space where linear separation is possible. The most commonly used kernel functions are linear, polynomial, radial basis function (RBF), and sigmoid.\n",
    "\n",
    "    3. Hyperplane Selection: In the transformed feature space, SVM tries to find the hyperplane that maximizes the margin between the support vectors of different classes. The margin is the perpendicular distance between the hyperplane and the closest support vectors. This maximization process is known as the optimization problem of SVM.\n",
    "\n",
    "    4. Margin Optimization: SVM solves the optimization problem by minimizing the hinge loss, which penalizes misclassifications and encourages a larger margin. The optimization problem can be solved using quadratic programming or other optimization techniques.\n",
    "\n",
    "    5. Classification: Once the hyperplane with the maximum margin is obtained, it can be used for classification. New, unlabeled data points can be mapped into the feature space using the same kernel function, and then classified based on which side of the hyperplane they fall.\n",
    "\n",
    "    SVM has several advantages, such as effective handling of high-dimensional data, ability to work with both linearly separable and non-linearly separable data, and resistance to overfitting. However, SVM's performance may be affected by the choice of kernel function and hyperparameters, and it can be computationally expensive for large datasets."

    "    The optimal number of models in an ensemble depends on various factors, including the dataset, the individual models used, and the performance metrics. Adding more models to the ensemble can initially improve performance, but beyond a certain point, the benefits start diminishing while the complexity and computational cost increase. The number of models in an ensemble can be chosen based on cross-validation or performance monitoring on a separate validation set. It is important to strike a balance between performance improvement and practical considerations such as time and resource constraints."
