    "The transformer architecture offers several advantages over traditional RNN-based models:\n",
    "\n",
    "a) Parallel Processing: Unlike RNNs that process sequential data sequentially, the transformer architecture enables parallel processing of the input sequence. This is achieved through the self-attention mechanism, which allows the model to consider relationships between any two positions directly. Parallel processing significantly speeds up training and inference, making the transformer more computationally efficient.\n",
    "\n",
    "b) Capturing Long-Range Dependencies: Traditional RNNs, such as LSTMs or GRUs, suffer from the vanishing gradient problem, limiting their ability to capture long-range dependencies. In contrast, the self-attention mechanism in transformers allows them to effectively model global dependencies by attending to any position in the input sequence. This enables transformers to capture long-term dependencies more efficiently.\n",
    "\n",
    "c) Scalability: The transformer architecture scales well with the length of the input sequence. Unlike RNNs, which require sequential processing and memory usage that grows linearly with the sequence length, transformers have a fixed computational cost regardless of the sequence length. This scalability makes transformers suitable for processing long documents or paragraphs.\n",
    "\n",
    "d) Context Understanding: Transformers excel at capturing contextual information. The self-attention mechanism allows the model to attend to different parts of the input sequence, capturing fine-grained relationships and context. Transformers can capture dependencies between words, phrases, or even longer spans in the text, leading to a better understanding of the input and improved performance in various natural language processing tasks.\n",
    "\n",
    "e) Transfer Learning: Transformers can leverage pre-trained language models, such as BERT or GPT, to benefit from large-scale language modeling tasks. Pre-training on a vast amount of text data enables transformers to learn general language representations, which can then be fine-tuned on specific downstream tasks. This transfer learning capability has contributed to the remarkable performance of transformers across various natural language processing applications."

    "\n",
    "a) Handling Long Sentences: Machine translation often involves translating sentences of varying lengths. Attention mechanisms allow the model to attend to different parts of the source sentence while generating the target translation. This allows the model to handle long sentences more effectively by selectively focusing on the most relevant words or phrases at each step.\n",
